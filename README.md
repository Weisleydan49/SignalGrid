**#SignalGrid**

**Project Overview**

SignalGrid is an autonomous community situational awareness system that transforms real-time human reports into continuously updated, actionable intelligence. Community members submit signals using text, voice, images, or short videos. The system reasons over these multimodal inputs to detect emerging events, cluster related incidents, track how situations evolve, and generate live situation briefs. SignalGrid is designed as an Action Era application powered by Gemini 3, focusing on sensing, reasoning, and continuous adaptation rather than static reporting.
